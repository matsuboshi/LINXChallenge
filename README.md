## Description of the project

The challenge was the creation of a landing page that loads initially 8 products in his body, and it loads more and more as the customers request it through the click of a button.

The whole HTML file was structured with the semantic elements from HTML5, and validation of the forms relies on built-in attributes.

CSS styling was implemented in a separate file, plus responsive features for a range of devices between a phone and a computer.

Regarding the logic built with JS, it is pretty concise to the point where it depends solely on 3 functions and 3 global variables.
